Docker Toolkit
==============

This is a useful toolkit used by [my docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/vihuvac/).

> **Note**:
>
> Every container gets this repo automatically, so if you are using one of my containers, there's no need for you to download it.
>
> Feel free to use it on your own containers.
